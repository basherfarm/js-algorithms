# Jump Search

Searching of a sorted array. 

* (1) Define a block size to jump
  * Depends on how fast the values increase or decrease and the length of the array.
* (2) Jump through the array in the defined block size.
  * In the case the array is sorted in ascending order:
    * If the element is smaller than the searched item jump up
    * If the element is greater than the searched item jump back and linear iterate up until found

        [0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 42, 50, 55, 70],
